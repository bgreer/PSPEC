PSPEC - takes a tracked tile and makes a power spectrum. Probably most useful for ring-diagram analysis.

If you happen to want to produce power spectra that are ready to be fit with either rdfitf or the multi-ridge code, then this is very useful. At some point I'd like to make some of the steps optional.

Steps:
1 - apodize
2 - fourier transform
3 - take power
4 - cart to polar
5 - subsample in theta

Usage:
./pspec {input fits file} {output fits file}
